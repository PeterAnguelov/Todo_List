# Todo_List

I have always stuggled with keeping track of all my tasks I need to do. I want a todo list but I'm too lazy to find a goods one. So I will make my own one. This is console version for streamline performance. I will eventually make an application version with some task dragging aspects to it. For not I am going to stick with this. This way I can make it the way I want and it can have the features I want. And this is most peoples first major project so lets do this.
